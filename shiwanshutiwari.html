                The Residency in Lucknow is a famous historical complex associated with the Indian Rebellion of 1857. It was the site of a prolonged siege during the rebellion, and the ruins of the Residency serve as a memorial to the British and Indian soldiers who lost their lives If there have been any developments or changes to the British Residency in Lucknow since my last update, I recommend checking with local authorities, tourism offices, or reliable online sources for the most up-to-date information. Additionally, consider visiting the official website of the Uttar Pradesh Tourism Department for details about historical sites in Lucknow.
